# EMAIL REGEN

## Description
EMAIL REGEN is a simple email re-generator that takes a user's email as input and regenerates similar variations while maintaining the same base. Any emails sent to the regenerated variations will always appear in the originally entered email. 

This project also includes a "Copy" button, which efficiently copies the generated email to the clipboard. Additionally, users can track used emails and view their history.

## Features
- Accepts a base email input.
- Generates multiple valid variations of the email.
- Ensures that all generated variations are deliverable to the primary email.
- Provides a "Copy" button to quickly copy the generated email.
- Maintains a list of used emails to prevent repetition.
- Includes a "View History" button to review previously generated emails.
